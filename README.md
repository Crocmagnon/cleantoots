# Cleantoots - ARCHIVED

This repository is now archived as the feature has been built into Mastodon itself.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2FCrocmagnon%2Fcleantoots%2Fbadge&style=flat)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/Crocmagnon/cleantoots/goto)

Cleantoots helps you delete your old toots. Because not everything we say on social medias should stay there for eternity.

## Install
### Using pip
```bash
python -m pip install cleantoots
```

### ArchLinux package
An ArchLinux package is available, see the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-cleantoots/).

## Config
### Initial setup
Only once

```bash
cleantoots config setup  # See the following section for config file options
cleantoots config login
```

### View and edit
You can later view the parsed config file with
```bash
cleantoots config list
```

You can edit the config file using
```bash
cleantoots config edit
```

This will open the config file using your preferred editor (`EDITOR` env variable).

## Config options

```ini
# Any key in this section will serve as a default for other sections
[DEFAULT]

# Toots that have at least this number of boosts won't be deleted.
boost_limit = 5

# Toots that have at least this number of favorites won't be deleted.
favorite_limit = 5

# Toots that are more recent than this number of days won't be deleted.
days_count = 30

# The timezone to use for dates comparisons.
timezone = Europe/Paris

# Each section represents an account.
[Fosstodon]
# Your Mastodon server URL.
api_base_url = https://fosstodon.org

# These files are used to store app information obtained when running `login`.
# The files must be different between accounts. Two different files are required per account.
app_secret_file = fosstodon_app.secret
user_secret_file = fosstodon_user.secret

# IDs of toots you want to protect (never delete).
# You can find the toot ID in the URL when viewing a toot.

    103363106195441418

# Tags you want to protect (never delete).
# Tags are matched case insensitively and are only matched for original toots (not for boosts):
# if you boost a toot containing #ScreenshotSunday it won't be protected by this rule.
# You MUST omit the `#` part of the tag.
protected_tags = 100DaysToOffload
    screenshotsunday

```

## Run

See `cleantoots config` for the current config.

```bash
cleantoots clean  # Defaults to a dry run. Does NOT delete.
cleantoots clean --delete  # Delete without prompt.
```

## Add an account
```bash
cleantoots config edit  # Opens editor so you can add your config
cleantoots config list  # Check your newly added account
cleantoots config login --only-missing  # Store credentials for your newly created account
cleantoots clean --delete
```

## Remove an account

cleantoots config clear-credentials

# You can then edit the config and remove some accounts:

cleantoots config login
```
